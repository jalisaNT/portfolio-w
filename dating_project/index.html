      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p id="txt">
        <b>Objective:</b>
        A key goal was to showcase a diverse range of dating views without bias. I incorporated commonly agreed-upon tweets (identified by high engagement) alongside more niche perspectives to reflect the broad landscape of dating opinions. The final output was designed to be visual, playful, and engaging, moving away from a purely analytical look.
        <br><br>
        <b>Data Collection:</b> 
        I collected data from Twitter using the Twitter API via Tweepy. Tweets were retrieved under dating-related tags (e.g., dating apps, talking stages) and from active accounts like The Receipts Podcast and Oloni that frequently discuss dating topics.
        To meet the goal of collecting "big data" and ensure a wide range of perspectives, I scraped tweets over a month, focusing on both popular and niche opinions. Retweets were removed to avoid repetition, and scraping was done regularly to maintain a large and varied dataset.
        <br><br>
        <b>Processing:</b> 
        Tweets were cleaned by removing stopwords, punctuation, and emojis using NLTK. They were tokenized to extract keywords for analysis.
        Sentiment analysis using NLTK’s VADER tool determined whether each tweet was positive, negative, or neutral. This allowed me to gauge public sentiment across different dating topics.
        <br><br>
        <b>Theme Organization:</b> 
        Tweets were organized into themes by conducting frequency analysis to find the most common words and recurring topics. Tweets were grouped based on these themes into separate files.

      </div>
      <p id="txt">
        <b>Engagement and Reviews:</b> 
        I scraped like and retweet counts to measure tweet engagement. Topics were reviewed based on majority sentiment:
        <br>
        Positive reviews were marked with a thumbs-up.
        Negative reviews were marked with a thumbs-down.
        Three out of ten topics had more positive than negative reviews (note: Tinder was not included in the final review section due to layout constraints).
        Analysis showed that negatively reviewed topics often reflected past experiences, while positively reviewed topics (like dating advice and finding love) depicted hopefulness, emphasizing optimism about future relationships. This insight inspired the final page’s focus on tweets about finding love.
        <br><br>
        <b>Summary of Process:</b> 
        Clean tweets → Extract keywords → Group into themes → Analyze sentiment → Sort by engagement → Curate selection 
        <br><br>
        Both the most engaged tweets and randomly selected niche tweets were included to balance widespread and different perspectives.

      <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <div id="txt">
        <p>The developer account I had with Twitter was v1, so I had limited access to Twitter API’s features.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One limitation was that I could only scrape 100 tweets at a time. At the start of the project, I also faced latency issues, which meant I could only collect 100 tweets every 15 minutes, making the scraping process initially very slow and tedious.</li>
          <li>When I started my project, Twitter’s API had recently undergone drastic changes. Previously, most features were free, so the possibility of further updates restricting access posed a constant threat.</li>
          <li>I could only access tweets from a maximum of 9 days, limiting the historical range of data — for example, I couldn't retrieve tweets about dating during the COVID-19 lockdowns.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> To overcome these issues, I collected data consistently and in advance to ensure a variety of topics and opinions before any further API restrictions could impact the project. Frequent scraping sessions were scheduled over a month to build a larger and more varied dataset.</p>
    
        <p>Another challenge was the inaccuracy of sentiment analysis. The tool occasionally misinterpreted sentiment — sometimes reading negative tweets as positive and vice versa.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To address this, I chose to display the review section using thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons instead of numerical statistics, as the sentiment analysis was not reliable enough for precise scoring.</p>
