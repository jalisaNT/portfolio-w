          Natasha is a university international student who has recently moved to the UK. She is currently homesick and wants to make homemade pierogi. Most ingredients can be found at Tesco, but the recipe requires Skwarki (greaves food). When she Google searches "polish supermarkets south London," most options shown are very expensive and don't contain authentic Polish groceries, rather catered to a British audience.

        <h4>How Global Groceries Will Benefit</h4>
        <p>
          Natasha will be provided a broad list of Polish supermarkets which are authentic depending on the area. For example, West London has a large Polish community so the shops will be more authentic as they're tailored for the majority of the area. The price point of each shop will also be specified.
